                     <li>A child is a unique individual, possessing dignity and worth.</li>
                     <li>A child develops physically and intellectually at a rate that is particular to
                        them and each child has different learning approaches and multiple ways of understanding.</li>
                     <li>Education is a gradual process which starts in the home, is enhanced through the school, and
                        continues throughout life.</li>
                     <li>Formal education is a shared responsibility between parents and the school.</li>
                     <li>A school should provide a safe environment which nurtures social and emotional well-being of a
                        child.</li>
                     <li>A school should work hard to educate the whole child, providing experiences in intellectual
                        development, physical exercise, creative production, social cooperation, and character
                        formation.

                     <li>An international school like Beautiful Minds should foster respect and understanding among
